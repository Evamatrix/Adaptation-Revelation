# Team 12: Adaptation Revelation

# How our UI functions
Our UI functions like a mobile application. The purpose of our UI is to make it easy to connect international student users to one another through shared traits such as culture, religion, language, and interests.

# Requirements for running UI

For running the application, it is best done on a mobile device. Users can run the code after installing the dependencies, and a QR code should be generated. For mobile devices, ensure that mobile device and computer running the application are on the same wifi and that you have the Expo Go app on your mobile device. If the QR code doesn’t work, they can type the “exp://” line from the command line on the computer into an Internet browser to connect.

- For IOS devices: users can scan the QR code with their phone cameras to open the application on Expo Go.
- For Android devices: users can scan the QR code with the Expo Go app (can be downloaded in Google Play appstore).
- For testing on the web: users can press w after running the code to load a local host version of the application on their web browser.

In order to sign up for the app, users will need to input a school email. Any email ending in .edu will be accepted as a valid input. It is recommended to test the application with a UTD email.
